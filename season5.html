        <p>The SAMCRO crew return under new leadership in series 5, but still experiencing the same old problems with rival gangs, the police and internal strife. Freshly appointed president Jax (Charlie Hunnam) deals with trouble from every angle, including an ambushed gun shipment, the death of a friend and headaches from his mother Gemma (Katey Sagal). Meanwhile, Tig (Kim Coates) lives through a nightmare, and Tara (Maggie Siff) does her best to protect the club. Series regulars Ron Perlman, Mark Boone Jr. and Ryan Hurst are also back, while newcomers Jimmy Smits and Harold Perrineau add a dynamic element to the series.</p>
