        <p>Sons of Anarchy MC, is a motorcycle club that operates both illegal and legal businesses through its many charters in various U.S. states, some Canadian provinces and at least three charters overseas. Specifically, the MC's mother charter, Redwood Original (aka SAMCRO) combines arms dealing with an automotive garage, plus involvement in the pornographic and prostitution industries. Residing in Charming, CA, SAMCRO acts as the unofficial protector of its small town and holds the respect of its people. The charter however is not as united as it may outwardly appear. President, Clay, likes it old school and violent; while Jax, his stepson and the club's VP, has thoughts about changing the way things are, based on his dead father's manuscript & intentions for the club he founded decades ago. Their conflict has effects on both the club and their personal relationships.</p>
